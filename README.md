## Summary
CCExtractorâ€™s last stable release (v0.94) came out in 2021, and since then, the codebase has undergone significant modifications. My work has primarily been to ensure that the project is ready for a release by fixing regressions, migrating the Flutter-based GUI and ensuring that the sample platform (which is used for running regression tests) is stable.

## Sample Platform Improvements
Prior to my involvement with CCExtractor during GSoC I noticed that the [sample platform](https://github.com/CCExtractor/sample-platform) was not working as expected with all the tests ending in failure. Over the course of GSoC, I've made around 12 [PRs](https://github.com/CCExtractor/sample-platform/issues?q=is%3Apr%20author%3Ahrideshmg%20state%3Aclosed) for various fixes and improvements to the platform, here is a brief note on some of them:

- Migrated the platform to Ubuntu 24.04 to fix build failures due to Tesseract
- Optimized Windows VM startup times by around 10 mins through the use of Rclone copy
- Fixed WTV tests timing out due to how Rclone handles chunked reads for large files
- Implemented platform independent tracking for when a regression test last passed on the master branch
- Implemented file caching on Linux and Windows VMs reducing API load and preventing timeouts due to rate limits
- Updated the installation guide for the platform as it was outdated
- Various misc fixes for fixing certain regressions

The sample platform is now fully operational and stable.

## Flutter GUI updates
The [Flutter GUI](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractorfluttergui) had not been updated in a while and hence was refusing to build on the latest Flutter SDK. I [migrated](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractorfluttergui/pull/68) the project and its dependencies to the latest SDK. I also made a [PR](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractorfluttergui/pull/69) to sync the changes in CCextractor with the GUI.

## Week Wise Reports
These reports were written during the GSoC period.
