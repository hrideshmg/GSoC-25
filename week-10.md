This week, I continued fixing regressions reported by the sample platform. Removed the API structures from `ccextractor.c`, to fix a regression under the options category. Also worked on. Also fixed all regressions under the DVD category, which had a side effect of fixing two other regressions. 

Also fixed a bug in the sample platform that was causing the server to return 500 internal server errors for freshly made tests.
