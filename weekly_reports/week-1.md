### Debugging Windows Test Timeouts on the CCExtractor Sample Platform

During this week, I attempted to fix the Windows tests on the CCExtractor sample platform, which were previously getting stuck and exiting prematurely. After some investigation, I traced the issue back to [Rclone](https://forum.rclone.org/t/vfs-is-slow-when-reading-in-small-8-bytes-chunks/40161) and how it handles chunked reads for large files internally through the WinFSP emulator for FUSE.

I discovered a WinFSP option that alters how file reads are handled. Enabling this option allowed the tests to run without getting stuck, which initially appeared to resolve the problem.

However, after applying this patch, the tests consistently timed out. Assuming the cause was related to the changes I had made to Rclone, I spent a lot of time experimenting with different configurations, but without success.

Eventually, after further testing, I realized the slowdown was actually due to CCExtractor itself. Comparing runtimes showed that certain files in previous successful Windows tests (such as [this one](https://sampleplatform.ccextractor.org/test/5027)) completed in under a minute, whereas the current tests were taking more than 15 minutes, even when the test file was cloned locally.

Currently, I'm in the process of isolating and tracking down what is causing these slowdowns.
