# Week 11
This week I made a [PR](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/pull/1729) to fix few regressions under the CEA-708 category. Got it and the DVD regression [PR](https://github.com/CCExtractor/ccextractor/pull/1729) merged, so now there is only one regression remaining under Linux as reported by the sample platform.

The sample platform has been occasionally timing out on certain large WTV files, it occurs randomly and I've not yet found a way to reproduce it consistently, will look into that and the Flutter GUI this week.
